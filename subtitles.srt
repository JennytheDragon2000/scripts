1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,902
Kubernetes is one of the most popular tools in

2
00:00:03,956 --> 00:00:07,178
cloud computing and is becoming more and more popular

3
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:10,778
every day. All the projects are migrating to Kubernetes

4
00:00:10,874 --> 00:00:14,334
and it is already becoming the standard in most companies

5
00:00:14,532 --> 00:00:18,506
as a result. Of course, the need for IT professionals

6
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:22,250
who know Kubernetes is higher than ever and is increasing

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,942
every year. But the demand for Kubernetes professionals is

8
00:00:25,996 --> 00:00:30,098
way higher than the number of people who actually know Kubernetes.

9
00:00:30,274 --> 00:00:33,554
This means if you invest time in learning Kubernetes

10
00:00:33,602 --> 00:00:37,106
and getting certified as a Kubernetes administrator,

11
00:00:37,218 --> 00:00:41,178
you'll have an incredible advantage and a head start in your IT

12
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:44,890
career. Now, Kubernetes is not the easiest tool

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,890
to learn, set up and manage, so if you want to become

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,186
a Kubernetes administrator you will need to learn a bunch

15
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:56,238
of stuff. I have taught hundreds of thousands of people

16
00:00:56,404 --> 00:00:59,902
Kubernetes through my videos and now I have created this

17
00:00:59,956 --> 00:01:03,882
full course to teach you everything necessary to get started

18
00:01:03,956 --> 00:01:07,506
with kubernetes from zero and become an expert in

19
00:01:07,528 --> 00:01:11,934
it. You will be prepared to handle any issues in the cluster.

20
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:15,334
You will know exactly how Kubernetes works and be able

21
00:01:15,372 --> 00:01:19,730
to support teams in your company to use kubernetes properly

22
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,942
after completing this course. This course is mostly demo

23
00:01:24,076 --> 00:01:27,462
led projects where you work hands on along

24
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:31,002
with me, to practically apply all the concepts you learn,

25
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:35,034
but also understand the use cases of each concept and

26
00:01:35,072 --> 00:01:38,154
really know why and how to use it. And to make

27
00:01:38,192 --> 00:01:41,694
understanding the theoretical concepts easier. We have

28
00:01:41,812 --> 00:01:45,774
animated videos and real world examples to understand how

29
00:01:45,812 --> 00:01:49,534
it all applies in the real world projects. Now you

30
00:01:49,572 --> 00:01:53,406
also know how important it is to prove your knowledge in

31
00:01:53,428 --> 00:01:56,914
the it world and a certification is a great way to

32
00:01:56,952 --> 00:02:00,754
show your skills and this course prepares you completely

33
00:02:00,952 --> 00:02:05,178
for the CKA exam so that you can become a certified

34
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:09,698
Kubernetes administrator. So let's go through the course contents

35
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:13,714
and see what you will learn from our Kubernetes administrator

36
00:02:13,762 --> 00:02:17,282
course. We will start with the main Kubernetes concepts

37
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:20,666
and understand how Kubernetes architecture works,

38
00:02:20,768 --> 00:02:24,982
what Kubernetes resources are, learn about Kubernetes configuration

39
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:28,406
files and generally how to work with Kubernetes.

40
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:31,710
We will then install a Kubernetes cluster from

41
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,486
scratch on virtual machines. For that we will use a

42
00:02:35,508 --> 00:02:38,766
Kubeadm tool and learn and understand all the

43
00:02:38,788 --> 00:02:42,286
concepts about control plane processes, how they work,

44
00:02:42,388 --> 00:02:46,290
how they get configured and so on. You will also learn about

45
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,906
container runtime interface in Kubernetes and how is

46
00:02:49,928 --> 00:02:53,314
it possible to use different container runtime technologies with

47
00:02:53,352 --> 00:02:57,334
Kubernetes. We will also look at a very interesting topic which

48
00:02:57,372 --> 00:03:01,330
is networking in Kubernetes and container

49
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,674
networking interface. We will learn about how pod

50
00:03:04,722 --> 00:03:08,826
networking works and how it is configured, as well as install a

51
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:13,190
networking plugin to create a networking layer in our Kubernetes

52
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,918
cluster. We will also learn how DNS works in Kubernetes

53
00:03:17,014 --> 00:03:20,798
and learn about core DNS which is the DNS service

54
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:23,982
in Kubernetes. We will also take a look at how

55
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:27,662
certificates work in Kubernetes, what certificates get

56
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:31,818
automatically created, and how you as a Kubernetes administrator

57
00:03:31,914 --> 00:03:35,346
can manage that. In the same section we will also learn

58
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:39,390
about very important Kubernetes concepts like namespaces,

59
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,962
how to work with Kubectl which is a Kubernetes command line

60
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:46,114
tool. You will learn about Kubeconfig file and

61
00:03:46,152 --> 00:03:49,414
how to use that to connect to the cluster, as well as how to

62
00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:52,786
configure and modify that and also using Kubeadm

63
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:56,134
tool you will learn how to join any worker nodes to

64
00:03:56,172 --> 00:04:00,006
the cluster. Once you have installed and configured the cluster,

65
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:03,450
of course you want to start deploying your applications in it

66
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,206
and make it accessible externally. So we will learn how to deploy

67
00:04:07,238 --> 00:04:11,642
applications inside the cluster using deployments

68
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:15,310
and how to make them accessible with services.

69
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,034
You will also learn about different types of services in kubernetes,

70
00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:22,622
how to use each one, and more importantly, how they

71
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:26,782
compare to each other. One of the common ways of configuring external

72
00:04:26,846 --> 00:04:31,090
access to our applications running in Kubernetes is

73
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,594
ingress. So you will learn what ingress controller is and

74
00:04:34,632 --> 00:04:38,178
how to create ingress resources to configure

75
00:04:38,274 --> 00:04:41,666
routing in a cluster. And since we will be installing

76
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:45,622
the ingress controller application using Helm, you will also learn

77
00:04:45,676 --> 00:04:49,094
what helm is, how it works, and how to use it to

78
00:04:49,132 --> 00:04:52,802
easily install different applications in Kubernetes.

79
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:56,790
Now of course, you won't be the only one working with the cluster because

80
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,860
developer teams and other people will also need access.
