Comment by @MosiurRahman-dl5ts: Maybe it is about time you make a video about WordPress.
Comment by @Asspirin101: Had to work on angular project recently (after ~4 years of react) and even the code itself was shit all of the angular apis and serviced turned out to be really nice. Would not mind it becoming the one true framework tbh.
Comment by @misssmitten2402: At work they have the developers learning React. Wonderful direction they have the developers going in.

No really, its super cool too

Comment by @komjungin7174: angular strikes back

Comment by @HiYesThisIsJake: can we call it a framework yet?
Comment by @collinthomas6288: As a fellow React hater I agree it’s about time reactivity is built into the web spec
Comment by @xbmcme9768: I'm so glad I dumped React years ago. I would have had to learn it for a 3rd (maybe even 4th) time with all these changes.

 -- duh how did you not mess up there 😂
Comment by @bahit: 2:35 "PHP without Lambos" 😂 sounds like he is talking about Taylor Otwell (Laravel). Or I might be missing something here. Hehe
Comment by @swapnasaritnayak2569: Its funny how react gained momentum from the likes of angular because angular was a framework with unnecessary 'compiler' just to come back in the future with their own compiler 😂😂😂.
Angular is actually the one true framework out there .
Comment by @SAMIGAMER44: PHP
Look at what they have to do to mimic a fraction of our power
Comment by @arbobmehmood5831: Not Framework. LiBrArY.

Comment by @rehanhanar: Angular 🙌🏻🔥
Comment by @diegoulloao: It was never great
Comment by @browntigerus: You are right, they are converging. React just needs to add new feature "signals"🤣. There will be ONE framework to rule them ALL (LOL never).

Comment by @Pickleboy2011: Fucking hate react. Not the framework itself, but the bloatware and the constant changes that create even more confusion. I recently went back to vanilla JavaScript and it is so refreshing 👌

Comment by @FurryNonsense: I'll say what everyone is about to comment

...huh?
Comment by @adamleblanc5294: We will create the one universal framework, taking all the best bits of each framework and stop this bloodshed.... 12 months later: There are now n+1 JS frameworks.
Comment by @thekwoka4707: JQuery updating means nothing. Everyone that uses it doesn't know about it or how to upgrade it, probably already have 3 different versions on their site anyway, and people not using it don't want it.
Comment by @samus33529: Angular is doo doo.  It will never be the leading front-end framework.  Keep on dreaming
Comment by @SmirkInvestigator: I'm going to miss your React jabs, hopefully they add more junk back in.
Comment by @truth-12345.: This is why I'm discouraged of all this javascript libraries and the javascript environment itself, there are always new libraries and frameworks that do slightly better than the older ones and it's constantly changing. This is more like a hobby and not a career intended.
Comment by @wuelbercastillo4367: Actions DX being like PHP but without Lambos, I lost it there ☠️

Comment by @dmitrychernivetsky5876: Hahaha. Compiler... the frontend devs invented compiler.... I can't, please... compiler for javascript, oh my days, this is too much!
Comment by @maxijonson: So React is finally a framework now? 😅
Comment by @agusghost1759: react-nextjs still need more upgrade for SSR and client, we looking that after using nuxt/vueJs than react
Comment by @user-ee8pe6se6t: Vuejs is far superior than React: it was better planned. I don't get why people are still using React. React is just patches upon patches
Comment by @nrg4285: I love RuneScape runes... thank you Svelte. One could pose that React is like Runecrafting, the worst skill to max. Whereas other frameworks give you runes for free. Amazing.
Comment by @drakephillips7613: I like React.
Comment by @fcnealvillangca7943: Good thing im only maintaining a todo app with react and Django with my main apps 😂
Comment by @shaneperreault: Why didn’t you add a cover sheet to your TPS report? Did you get the useMemo?
Comment by @lakhveerchahal: You should start using the latest logo of Angular
Comment by @unknownd3v: "To memoize or not to memoize.." 😂
Comment by @iwolfman37: how come flutter is never shown in these? that's the one i chose to learn
Comment by @maximus1172: Svelte 5 is gonna blow the competition away :)
Comment by @jampu: memowize
Comment by @jouebien: in a lot cases using memo/callback is a skill issue of reaching for optimisation way before you need it. If you are having performance issues you should be addressing your state design first. So many times have I had to dig into a bug only to realise that the bug only exists because someone else didn't know or address the pitfalls of memo/callback/reducer.
Comment by @HarshSharma-uv6zq: I’m gonna say it ..
React is turning into angular day by day
Comment by @abhisheksharma9796: I literally watched the whole video without audio, and it still made sense
Comment by @PHPLITHIUM: this is HUUUUUGe. Fu*@ useMemo and forwardRef.
Comment by @joyoffrontend: does that mean courses based react gets updated again? I AM LEARNING REACT HAVENT STARTED HOOKS YET? SHOULD I LEARN IT OR SHOULD I LEARN NEW REACT 19

Comment by @bishopoftroy: What does even Idris Elba have to do with React anyway?
Comment by @bugtank: Why would you do the Angular thing at the end? I finally had peace after 22 years of web development. And then you did the Angular thing at the end. I'm going to cry. I'm crying. (Waiting)
Comment by @maenam4520: “I will see you in the next js one 😀”
Hidden message to have nextjs great again.
Comment by @luke8954: Me who knows nothing but still has been patronized against react
Comment by @i_Have2BrainCells: So i should learn angular instead of react? Because react seems like a huge dumpsert fire. And as all the modern frameworks looks and acts the same just with different syntax, is it okay to learn Angular instead of react? (Currently i am learning web dev, and rn learning Vanilla JavaScript)
Comment by @ethreix800: Even though DK effect is not proven to exist, if it was, then "arrogant and smug js developer" would be a prime example of it. Stick to making dynamic web menus, lol.
Comment by @retagainez: Wow. React easily removing syntax that it created. Some of the worst looking code I've seenn was with useMemo and forwardRefs... I'm using the latest ASAP if I ever work in React ever again.
Comment by @kittydaddy2023: I don't know what any of these words mean. I'm just here for the memes.
Comment by @t3dotgg: React is okay I guess
Comment by @CalifornianViking: It is all for nothing. The majority of these web2 frameworks will be replaced by HTMX.
Comment by @keyboard_g: I skipped a lot of the JS wars after Angular. Doing C# Blazor now and shipping. Some JS sites are bigger than all of .Net downloading as wasm.

Comment by @user-ts9ks8in2n: Compiler!
Comment by @gmonie619: Svelte(Kit) instead
Comment by @playhard719: Everything will eventually evolve to Crabs, that's we all should start using rust for everything.
Comment by @HoangDuck666: 3:24 the best part
Comment by @ArunShankartheRealOne: I will stand with Solid or Svelte.
Comment by @alulaleak: React has too many libraries to be replaced so shoutout to all the JS frameworks that think they could win the war. At least they keep pushing React to be better.
Comment by @caribouroadfarm: I just watched whole 4 minutes and still not sure what the author tries to say.
Comment by @00euclid: React in its infinite wisdom made so many contradictory choices and now when they so graciously remove their contradictions, we have to go back to our old codes and fix the mistakes that we never made. God, I wish I could just use Svelte at work so I could put an end to this madness or Vue.
Comment by @najmulhc: Did google paid for this video?
Comment by @TheAdnanZaib: React is the one true framework.
Comment by @crazycode2578: react is currently perfect, why need to change??

Comment by @omerbresinski: bro at my job im the "memoize" guy, performance fixes everywhere, I feel like a rug is being pulled under me with these useMemo/useCallback changes lol
Comment by @henrymach: React was never great
Comment by @dr.d3600: BTW, are you already upgrade to react 18? 😂
Comment by @gregfenton: It is REVERT.  It is not REVERT BACK.
It is "reply".  It is not "reply back".
It is "8am".  It is not "8am in the morning".
It is "naked".  It is not "naked with no clothes on".

Comment by @jurycould4275: He said Angular as a joke by the way... Asking an applicant about their favorite frontend framework, especially backend devs, is a really good way to gauge their IQ and aptitude for web development. If the answer isn't React or Vue, it's bad and if they insist on using Angular or Svelte, you know they are bad at their job and will bring toxicity to the workplace as well.
Comment by @markg5891: What's one of the powers of je? It's an interpreted language, you don't need a compiler. So let's add a compiler to make it "better" 🤯

I don't get the compiler madness in js land.
Don't even get me started about the brutal insanity of bundlers. That wrecks the usefulness of CDNs as each bundle now is unique per site...

If you want a compiler, use a language that compiles to machine code.or go and put some effort in js modernization to add the features you need on a language level.
Comment by @dan110024: these videos make me realise i know sfa about react which in turns makes me depressed realising i'll forever be a basic bitch at an agency

Comment by @tranquillityEnthusiast: React is trying to become Angular 😂😂😂 ok got it
Comment by @LakkThereof: Angular Master Race time is near
Comment by @oglaucio: Web development has become so unreasonably convoluted, with so much gatekeeping. It is sad that someone wanting to get into it needs to choose a cult to follow. And, if you only decide to learn (well) HTML5, CSS and JS you're seen as a noob.
Comment by @joshuaevans4301: The one true framework already exists. It's called the DOM

Comment by @varunrao5857: Damn I thought I will shift to next js
Comment by @mantovani96: Let me see if I got it right. We’re gonna use use to avoid using useEffect where we used to use async functions. A lot of uses of “use” hahha
Comment by @theyioel: Nah
Comment by @TopOppTy: Taylor Otwell's Orange Lamborghini being synonymous with PHP since 2015 is hilarious
Comment by @JM-fz1ct: All hail Angular, our one true framework.
Comment by @RicoCollins: and by "you can already use actions in NextJS" you meant "you can already use actions the way React will implement them, in Remix"
Comment by @gilarchi501: Yesterday i learn "svelte", and now fireship says "react great again". 😑😮‍💨

Comment by @iAmTaki: I didn't understood a word of this video and this is what I love about programming. I can write all these cool C/C++ stuff but when it gets to web development I suck. There's so much more to learn, so much to get better at. Software Enginnering is amazing.
Comment by @erickmoya1401: The gap between svelte and react stays, but for me is more important the gap between svelte kit and Next.
Abstracted behavior instead of literal magic.

Comment by @mrkostya008: They didnt drop ie 11 support for jquery 4 unfortunately
Comment by @Toleich: It's time to get rid of HTML and the DOM. The framework war will persist until that happens.
Comment by @BraveTravelerK: Angular is the only choice as the one true framework... everything else is just a subset of it.
Comment by @tommybronze3451: I thought that they fixed it by abandoning js ;) well I guess they still have a long way to go :D
Comment by @Dylan_thebrand_slayer_Mulveiny: Oh look. Another major react release that applies more bullshit to fix all the issues caused by the other bullshit they've added in previous releases. At this point, React has become a giant pile of spaghetti and band-aids. 

This is the same pattern other frameworks like Angular have followed, and it's a strong signal that React is dying the same slow painful death they are. I feel bad for developers that have accrued all the tech debt that comes with using it.

Comment by @wissendev5490: One true framework is not using framework at all.
Comment by @momanmirul: my roman empire is the promise of frameworks to be a more streamlined way of development, only to grow into behemoths with its own convoluted learning curves and make you doubt if any of it was even worth it compared to just hand-wrenching vanilla JS with HTML/CSS

Comment by @jugalgadhavi: Wake up babe, we don't have to use usehooks which we used to have functionality of using a usehook, now we just have to use use to use the promises as opposed to usehooks
Comment by @drewfisher4603: At least with RSC, the Suspense boundary acts as an ErrorBoundary, if you want the error boundary to do something different, it needs to be inside of the suspense boundary. I agree that this is a pretty clunky API.

Comment by @figloalds: Yeah Angular is great, but I'm team Svelte
Svelte and Solid are the ones bringing the right ideas to the scene, they should be the standard
Watching this video made me realize that I didn't hate React enough, and that even with these improvements, it's still abhorent.
Comment by @thatJackBidenTalksAbout: oh come on, a compiler? seriously?!

Good bless the coming generations of frontend devs never haveing to see that abomination in their first companie's codebase
Comment by @tedchandler5431: Wow. A compiler. Space-age technology right there. What a joke. If only we had compiled languages, hmm.....
Comment by @DaivG: Long Live the One True Framework!
Comment by @m-ok-6379: jQuery was ridiculously popular because everybody was using the same library and could go from project to project, unlike the JS framework environment that has many options where you have to deal with different frameworks using TS or older versions of the the framework.

Comment by @SungJuYea: My experience with React ends at 18. I can't even cover all the new hooks that provided by the React and Next.js, let alone all those other messy hooks by the third parties. Probably I would just use htmx with Go or even simply the Jinja template haha...
Comment by @maximumcockage6503: "Angular is having a renessaince" "react is great again"

Nah I'm done with frameworks that require an arm and a leg. Just give me Alpine.js with the Pinecone router and let me write some code in the HTML and I'm good.

Comment by @themystic5935: 1:37 Svelte 4 makes runes optional - dollar sign syntax is optional
Comment by @gustavbw: For anyone thinking "oh, a compiler, that just like <insert non-interpreted language>", unfortunately React, Svelte and Solid's use of the word "compiler" is just marketing. An actual compiler "compiles" to machine code, i.e. 010101.. you get the point, while what React, Svelte and Solid merely processes text and inserts statements. That in itself is nothing to scuff at, and honestly the only way to go ihmo to provide the best possible abstractions, but it does annoy me a lot that they either don't know what a compiler is (which I doubt) or chooses to mislabel their technology. 
For anyone not familiar with what a compiler consists of, let me summarize as it as lifetimes of human labour and some of the most intricate and advanced systems-level programming. Saying that a fancy text pre-processor is a compiler is kind of insulting. 
With that said, I'm an avid Svelte fan and have enjoyed much of what their "compiler" offers. I just wished they didn't try and market it as something it is not.
Comment by @jonnyeh: Doesn't the computed function in Vue use Signals, at runtime, to do the memoization? Signals are also available for React, and has the useComputed hook.

Comment by @GerinoMorn: I don't mind, even welcome the simplification compiler brings into everyday life.

I did however like the verbosity and deliberate use of specific patterns via hooks, though only with IDE support for the dependency array (which comes from compilation so my argument is kinda mute). I liked it mostly because it brings developer "closer" to what is actually happening, because sad truth is that there is... a number of essentially braindead codemonkeys just copying various stuff with no thought how it actually all works together...

Comment by @Horopter: You never make as many videos on Angular as you make on React and Svelte. Is Angular that bad?
Comment by @sentinelaenow4576: Nothing is fixed, they're only trying to look less shitty. As usual , hyped words like "compiler", which literally means absolutely nothing for React, as absolutely nothing has changed or will ever change to make it "compiled". This is even stated on the ReactTraining website, they confess it's just propaganda. This update is a statement of how awful React is, and how many mistakes they've made naive devs repeat again and again, saying it's the best thing, for nothing. Anyone excited for this is like a slave happy because the whip banging on his back changed colors. What a bunch of bullcrap.
Comment by @aberba: I've never used useMemo() or useCallback() in my code before. For some reason, I've never needed them. I don't see any performance problem with the kind of apps I buil. Glad they're going removed
Comment by @Zeragamba: Not sure I understand all the hate around React. I've found it's the simpliest of the view engines to use and is the closest to plain old Javascript. Angular is more of a kitchen sink type framework and does a lot more than I normally need or want. I'm also not a fan of using special characters for syntax.
Comment by @TurntableTV: 02:57 - man I wish these platforms used the poop emoji instead of dislike button. Or at least put it as a third option after Like and dislike. So you have things you like, things you dislike but are not shit and things that are shit. Fireship is a genius.

Comment by @nicejungle: Vue is not using a compiler. It's based on @vue/reactivity that make a massive use of native ECMAScript Proxy objects.
AlpineJS is also based on Proxy since it uses @vue/reactivity
Yes it's slow (about 2 times slower) but unless you're coding 3D rendering with BabylonJS for example, you don't care.

Comment by @quelkun: I hope that means React devs will stop repeating "it's just javascript" nonsense
Comment by @OMFGXeno: The fact that they added in a few years ago and are now refactoring to not need useMemo just goes to show that React is inferior when compared to Angular. But I bet you that won't stop the huge number of jobs for it instead of Angular or Vue. Ugh.

Comment by @jyby1: I wonder what effects these changes in React will have on the React Native side of things moving forward. Not every change is applicable, but then again, if the core APIs start to differ to much then React Native will lose a lot of its selling point in that it's "one code base" for three (or more) targets.

Comment by @daniel4dev: Something interesting, I don't think Vue's reactivity is achieved because of the compiler. If you console log a ref or reactive at runtime you can see the getters and setters are wrapped with some other calls that binds the reactivity. Which means your reactive code can be dynamic at runtime. Wild

I feel like the way React is evolving, if I'm not strictly a "React Developer" as my full time job or hobby, trying to understand the different syntax changes is difficult... This is more true as if I'm not actively building a project in React, my boilerplate knowledge fades quickly. It sucks when I need to do technicals in React as well :(

Comment by @seananderson7087: So. I actually like the hook system. There's few things I hate than automagic hidden logic.
It's unintuitive and creates a worse barrier to entry than just learning hooks.
And at some point in the process of using it, you'll inevitably end up butting heads with that hidden logic system.
But, I will remain hopeful that this is a good thing, because if it works well, it will be great.
Comment by @klutch4198: Muahahahaha yes!!!

Comment by @bencipherx: Great video and I’m not even sugarcoating it
Comment by @colinb8332: For me it’s SolidJS (wish it had more usage) for smaller or test projects and Angular for projects that will be large right off the bat or have a large amount of developers working on them. I personally am still not sold on the SSR frameworks; I’d rather split the concerns of backend and front end.
