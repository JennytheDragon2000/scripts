basic stuff for encoding a secret doesn't make it automatically secure the secret components are meant to be encrypted using third party tools in communities because communities doesn't equip them out of the box
and their tools for that from cloud providers or separate third party tools and you can deploy uncovered and is to encrypt your secrets and that will make secrets secure so secret would contain things like credentials and of course i'm in database user you could also put in conflict map but what's important me
the passwords certificates things that you don't want other people to have access to would go in the secrets and just like conflict map you just connected your pot so that pod can actually see those data and read from the secret you can actually use the data from conflict map or secret inside of your effort
location pod using for example environmental variables or even as a properties file so now it's it and other very important concepts generally which is data storage and how it works in communities so we have this database pod that our application uses and he has some data regenerate some data
with this set of that you see know if the database container or the pod gets restarted
the data would be gone and that's problematic an inconvenient obviously because you want your database data or log data to be persisted reliably long term
and the way you can do it in communities is using and other component of communities cold volumes
and how it works is that he basically attaches a physical storage on a hard drive to your pot and that storage could be either on a local machine meaning on the same server node word the pod is running or it could be on a remote storage meeting outside of the covenant is cluster it could be a cloud store
or age or could be your own premise storage which is not part of the covenant is cluster so you just have an external reference on it so now when the database pot or container gets restarted all the data will be there persisted it's important to understand the distinction between the coven it is cluster and all of it's come
poland's and the storage regardless of whether it's a local a remote storage think of a storage as an external hard drive plug in into the quran a this cluster because the point is coin is clustered explicitly doesn't manage any data persistence which means that you as well
it is user or an administrator are responsible for backing up the data replicating and managing it and making sure that it's kept on a proper hardware etc because it's not taken care of communities
so now let's see everything is running perfectly and a user can access or if kitchen through a browser
the with this setup what happens if my application pod dies right crushes or i have to restart the pod because i built a new container image basically i would have a downtime were a user can reach my application which is obviously a very bad thing
